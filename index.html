                    <h3>What I hope to Get out of Web Foundations</h3>
                    <p>I found the PCS JavaScript evening programs and quickly realized I didn't quite have the foundation to start off with one of those, and honestly I was a little leery of diving right in at that price tag, so the foundations series seemed like a good way to dip my toe in the water. What I would really like to get is this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An idea of whether my instinct about development as a career is right, and whether I am cut out for it.</li>
                    <li>An idea of what I might expect out of either the Full Stack or Ruby On Rails evening courses.</li>
                    <li>An idea of which course to take to be able to get an entry level development position.</li>
                    <li>The skills to not be totally lost in either of those courses.</li>
                    <li>Some friendly coding buddies would be a nice plus.</li>
                </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I don't know any JavaScrip.</li>
                        <li>I know very little CSS.</li>
                        <li>I don't know how to make my command line work right.</li>
                        <li>I don't know how to use Git yet!</li>
                        <li>I only have windows PCs.</li>

                    <p>This article is about <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp">CSS positioning</a>, which is finicky and tricky.</p>
                    <p>The position property can be used to determine what portion of the screen an element is tethered to:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>position:static</dt>
                                <dd>This is the default positioning. An item will behave as you would normally expect, scrolling off the screen, etc.</dd>
                            <dt>position:relative</dt>
                                <dd>This allows an element to be positioned relative to its normal position using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</dd>
                            <dt>position:fixed</dt>
                                <dd>Fixed position elements will be tethered to a spot on the screen even if the screen is scrolled.</dd>
